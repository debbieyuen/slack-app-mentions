# Slack App: Component Mention Counts ðŸ”¥
A Slack App feature that helps users determine how often a component/element/word was mentioned within Slack messages. The feature provides the user with a number count of the times a specific component is mentioned and referenced. 

The project starts off by creating a new [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/automation/create) and workspace to build my app. I chose to create a new workspace! Within the application, scopes were used to give the new app permission to do things. Under the **OAuth & Permissions** tab in the sidebar, add scopes to the app. The scopes that will be necessary include: 
* `channels:read`: This scope allows the app to retrieve a list of all the public channels in a workspace in order to pick one to retrieve a message from.
* `channels:history`: This scope lets the app view all the messages within any public channel in a workspace.

## Requirements
* [Slack CLI](https://api.slack.com/automation/quickstart)
* [Slack Pro Workspace](https://api.slack.com/start/overview)
* Python 3.12.0
* [Python Slack SDK 3.23.0](https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/)
* Slack Signing Secret key

## Python-Slack

In the root directory, create a **requirements.txt** file and add the following contents to the file.
```
slack_sdk>=3.0
slack_bolt>=1.6.1
certifi
```
Install the dependencies by running the following command from terminal. 
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Use Certifi's functions to locate installed certificate authority (CA) bundles.
```Python
import ssl as ssl_lib
import certifi

ssl_context = ssl_lib.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
```
